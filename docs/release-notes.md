# MainApp Release Notes
## February 2022 (version 2.5.2)



## New Features
### Email Signature button
We added an **Email Signature button** to the customer screen to create a custom email signature using the agency name and toll-free number. The email signature includes:

* Agency name (external)
* Toll-Free Number
* Main Team email
* Document request email
* Fax Number

Follow these steps to add the signature to your emails:

1. Open the customer record
2. Select **Email Signature** button to copy the signature
3. Paste the signature into the email body


## Improvements
### Agency and Customer Report
We updated the **Agency and Customer Report** to include the agency city and state. Use the filters to select the agency city and state to see policy counts and premium totals by location.

### _Program Name_ Agency Indicators
You can identify agents in our special handling _Program Name_ by an indicator on the Customer and Agency screen. Any calls or emails for _Program Name_ agents should be routed to the special handling team. 

## Bug Fixes
### Character Limit on Names
Previously, the system would error when you entered a user name longer than 25 characters. We corrected user names to allow for 50 characters.
